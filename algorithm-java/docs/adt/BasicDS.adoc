= Basic Data Structure

- Stack
- Queue
- Bag
- Priority Queue


== Stack

LIFO: Last In First Out

- LinkedList Implementation
  * push -> push
    * first node to first item
  * pop -> first item

== Queue

FIFO First In First Out

== Linked List

- Simple Linked List
- Double Linked List

insert/delete is o(1)
random-access is o(n)

- Add Operation
  * head.next -> cur (use temp to store head.next first)
  * cur.next-> copy_of(head.next)

- Delete
  * pre.next -> cur.next
  * cur.next -> null

- Delete First Node
  * assign the next node to head

- Design Linked List
   * Node: val/next
   * addAtHead
   * addAtTail
   * addAtIndex
   * deleteAtIndex
