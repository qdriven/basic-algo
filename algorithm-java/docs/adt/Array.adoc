= Data Structure - Array

Array in one of the fundamental blocks in data structure.

To understand array, you nee to understand following questions:

- array VS dynamic array
- basic operation of array and dynamic array
- multidimensional arrays and be able to use two-dimensional array
- Be able to use two-pointer technique to practical problems

== 1. Introduction to Array

Array: store a collection of elements ** sequentially **,but
elements can be ** accessed randomly **.

- Search array element by ** index **
- Basic Array structure:

=== 1.1 Basic Array Operation

some basic array operation:

1. initialize
2. get length
3. add element
4. iterate all elements
5. sort all elements

=== 1.2 Dynamic Array

dynamic array which is still random access list data
structure, but with variable size,that means, you need to
handle resize issue. In JAVA, ArrayList is the typical type.

=== 1.3 Two dimensional Array

One-dimensional array:

two dimensional array:

and ** dynamic two-dimensional array ** is just a nested dynamic array.

- Digonal Traverse
- Spiral Matrix
- Pascal's Triangle

=== 1.4 String

in JAVA String is immutable, so if concatenate with "+",
the space might be:

In Java, since the string is immutable, concatenation works by first allocating enough space for the new string, copy the contents from the old string and append to the new string.

Therefore, the time complexity in total will be:

Quote:
    5 + 5 × 2 + 5 × 3 + … + 5 × n
= 5 × (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)
= 5 × n × (n + 1) / 2,
which is O(n2).

Have a try with java microbenchmark


=== 1.5 Two Pointer

two pointers with different steps

sometimes,sort first and need a greedy thought.

=== 1.6 Array Related Techniques

- String
- HashTable
- LinkedList
- Queue
- Stack
- Binary Search
- two pointer
  * slow and faster pointer in linked list
  * sliding window
- Greedy strategy
